## Introducing Data Science
Data science is a thriving adn rapidly expanding field, as you probably already know.

# History of Data Science
1962: John Tukey writes The Futue of data analysis, where he envisions a new field for learning from data.
1977: Tukey publishes the book Exploratory Data Analysis, which is a key part of data science today.
1991: Guido Van Rossum publishes the python programming language online for the first time, which goes on to become the top data science language used at the time of writting.
1993: The R programming language is publicly released, which goes on to become the second most-used data science general-purpose language.
1996: The International Federation of Classification Societies holds a conference titled Data Science Classification and Related Methods - possibly the first time "data science" was used to refer to something similar to modern data science.
1997: Jeff Wu proposes renaming statistics data science in an inaguratin lecture at the University of Michigan
2001: William Cleveland publishes a paper describing a new field Data science which expands on data analysis.
2008: Jeff Hammerbacher and DJ patil use the term Data scientist in job postings after trying to come up with a good job title for their work.
2010: Kaggle.com launches  as an online data science community and data science competition website
2010s: Universities begin offering masters and bachelor's degrees in data science; data science job postings explode to new heights year after year; big breakthroughs are made in deep learning; the number of data science software libraries and publications burgeons.
2012: Harvard Business Review publishes the notorious article entitled Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century, which adds fuel to the data science fire.
2015: DJ Patil becomes the chief data scientist of the US for two years.
2015: TensorFlow (a deep learning and machine learning library) is released.
2018: Google releases cloud AutoML, democratizing a new automatic technique for machine learning and data science. 
2020: Amazon SageMaker Studio is released, which is a cloud tool for building, training, deploying, and analyzing machine learning models 

# Working Around Data Science
Data science involves a combination of programming skills, mathematics, statistics and creativity.

*Prograaming Language*
Python has been considered a top programming language and tool for performing data science tasks with a larger community support.

*Cloud tools*
Most parts of data science are shifting to cloud. The cloud is most useful when wroking with big datasets oe need to be able to rapidly scaleup. Some of the major cloud providers for data science include: Amazon Web Services(AWS), Google Cloud Platform(GCP), Microsoft Azure, IBM, DataBricks, Snowflake.

*Statistical methods and math*
Exploratory analysis statistics like statistical plotting and aggregate calculations such as quantiles, Statistical tests and their principles, like p-values, chi-squared tests, t-tests and ANOVA, machine learing modelling, including regression, classification and clustering methods, Probability and statistical distribution like gaussian and Poisson distribution are some of the essential statistical skills that are important in Data science

# Where can I specialize in Data Science
Specializing in data science depends on intrest and career goals, some of the fantastic areas of specializing in data science include:
1. Machine Learning
2. Business Intelligence
3. Deep learning
4. Data Engineering
5. Big Data
6. natural language processing (NLP)
7. Artificial Intelligence(AI)
