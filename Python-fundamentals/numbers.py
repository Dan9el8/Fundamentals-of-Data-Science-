# Data science uses math therefore understanding how to use numbers in python is cruicial,Intergers such as 2 and float such as 2.0.
# We can check the type of an object in Python with the function type(), such as type(2) which outputs int.

2 + 2 #Addition
2 - 2 #Subtraction
2 * 2 #multiplication
2 / 2 #division
n = 2 // 2 #Integer division

print(n)

#We can exponentiate numbers
2 ** 3

#We can find the reminder of integer division using
5 % 2

#We can convert integer to float and vice versa using
int(5.1)
float(5)

#We can also use built-in modules and packages using the math package
import math
