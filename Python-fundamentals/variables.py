# Variables in programming are used to hold values
mango = 1
# if we updated the variable such as adding 1 to books, we can overwrite the old variable with
mango = mango + 1

#There is a shortcut for math operations such as this in Python too
mango += 1
mango *= 1
mango /= 1
mango -= 1
mango **= 1
mango %= 1
