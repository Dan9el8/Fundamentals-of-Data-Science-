### Machine learning classification
Once our data has been prepared with some cleaning, feature selectionand feature engineering, we can begin using machine learning algorithms
Classification is under supervised learning since we have targets or labels in our data
In this chapter we will learn basics of classification with machine learning using sklearn and statsmodels packages:
Machine learning classification algorithms for binary and multi-class classification
Using machine learning classification algorithms for feature selection.
Machine learning algorithms take input data and learn, fit or train during a training phase. Then we use the statistical patterns learned from the data to make predictions during what is called "inference".
Here we will cover some of the basic and simple classification algorithms like:
Logistic regression
Naive Bayes
k-nearest neighbors(KNN)

# Logistic regression for binary classification
Logistic regression is primarly used for binary classification, although it can be used for multi-class classification as well.
It is part of agroup of models called generalized linear models(GLMs) that also includes linear regression. In some pytho packages, such as statsmodel, logistic regression can be implemented through a GLM class.
